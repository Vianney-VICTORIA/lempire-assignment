### Voila 🪄

## ⚠️ Disclaimer ⚠️

- Few improvements needs to be done for the dataflow to be more reactive e.g checkbox.
- A Collection Schema would be nice to have for validation.
- The UI has to be break it down. I am a big fan of the atomic approach, but it was a bit overkill for the test. I have used Tailwind, but with basic knowledge of blaze I am not sure if they are the best match.
- Finally, I have ignored doing test as the endpoint is pretty straight forward and the app is not for production even though I have done a bit of logic for the export.



# Hope to see you soon 👋🏾.
