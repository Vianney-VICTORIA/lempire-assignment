# Getting started

### Voila 🪄

## ⚠️ Disclaimer ⚠️

- Few improvements needs to be done for the dataflow to be more reactive.
- The UI has to be break it down. I am a big fan of the atomic approach but it was a bit overkill for the test. I have used Tailwind, but with basic knowledge of blaze I am not sure if they are the best match.
- Finally I have ignored doing test as the endpoint is pretty straigh forward and the app is not for production.



# Hope to see you soon 👋🏾.
